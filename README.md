# voice_assistant_using_AI
A graphical user interface with a little bot icone.
If the bot icone is ***Black*** means the system is inactive "it's not listening to commands" .. it's just waiting for the wake word **"Hey Jake"**

After saying the wake word, it turns to ***Red*** .. then it's going to process the voice command.
